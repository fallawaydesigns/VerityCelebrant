                        </p> -->
                        <p>Telling the detailed and intricate story of a person’s life is central to what I do.  A person’s life should not be defined by their death. We are all individuals and your loved ones’s funeral should fully reflect who they were.</p>
                        <p>I take a family-led approach, which means including only what you want to include. This can range from fully secular (non-religious) to incorporating prayers and hymns. You can personalise the ceremony with poems, stories and music and enable you to truly celebrate your loved one. 
                        </p>

                            <p>When I’m telling the story of your loved one’s life it can be as traditional or creative as you like. Personal tributes are welcome, and I can read them on your behalf if you prefer. I want to make this journey as easy as possible for you as we celebrate your loved one’s life.</p>
                            <p>When we discuss the service, I can meet you face to face, over the phone, email, or video call.  Any method that's best for you. When I come to see you, I have no time constraints.  We will be spending as long as you like talking through memories, stories and how you want the service structured to making sure it is perfect.

                        <p>The day itself can feel like a blur of emotions and it may feel that you’ve not been able to take everything on board. You will be presented with a printed and bound copy of the service to keep, as well as a digital PDF version.  This means you can take a moment to yourself and read through the ceremony in your own time, when you feel ready.</p>
                        
                        <p>I can also create a funeral services for individuals who wish to make their own arrangements prior to their passing. This enables you to have complete control over what is included in the service, as well as taking some of the pressure off of your loved ones.

                                    Personalised celebrations are at the heart of what I do. We are all individuals and those important events in our lives reflect all we hold dear. </p>

                                    <p>I work in Portsmouth, Gosport, Fareham, Emsworth, Hayling Island and Southampton.  I also cover the wider south Hampshire and West Sussex areas.  Though if you live further afield, I am always happy to travel.</p>
